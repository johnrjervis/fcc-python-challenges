# fcc-python-challenges
These are my solutions to some of the Python challenges on freeCodeCamp (with tests).

I wrote my own tests (with the UnitTest module) for my solutions to these challenges. Once I was happy with my code, I posted it on Replit and checked it against freeCodeCamp's official tests. If there were any failures, I updated my code (tests and solution) and then re-checked my solution against fCC's tests.

## Scientific Computing with Python

I enjoyed the Scientific Python course - it was nice to work on some challenges that were quite different to the work that I have done with Python so far. There wasn't a whole lot that was new to me, but it was good practice for listcomps and exceptions. Writing my own tests was a useful exercise, too, and I learnt how to capture terminal output with io.StringIO and got some good practice with mocks.
