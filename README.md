# fcc-python-challenges
These are my solutions to some of the Python challenges on freeCodeCamp (with tests).

I wrote my own tests (with the UnitTest module) for my solutions to these challenges. Once I was happy with my code, I posted it on Replit and checked it against freeCodeCamp's official tests. If there were any failures, I updated my code (tests and solution) and then re-checked my solution against fCC's tests.

## Scientific Computing with Python

I enjoyed the Scientific Python course - it was nice to work on some challenges that were quite different to the work that I have done with Python so far. There wasn't a whole lot that was new to me, but it was good practice for listcomps and exceptions. Writing my own tests was a useful exercise, too, and I learnt how to capture terminal output with io.StringIO and got some good practice with mocks.

## Data Analysis with Python

I didn't do much testing for this course, as the challenges were more about finding an answer to a specific question or creating a particular chart than creating code that would produce various results for a given range of inputs. I have not copied every line from the Replit boilerplate code supplied by fCC (especially comments), but I have mostly stuck to the supplied function structure. My code in this Repo may be slightly different from my solutions on Replit because of minor differences in the available versions of Pandas or other modules, but these differences are relatively few (e.g., in the Repo version of challenge #2, I've used an extra argument in pd.read_csv to remove whitespace).
